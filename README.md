# Hello From My Blog

This site stores blog posts in markdown.

## How It Works

Every time I write a blog post, I add it to the blog manifest. A React front-end
is set up to fetch the data from this manifest that includes URLs to each blog
post here. The front-end presents these as links in a list - when clicked, the site
will fetch the specific post from this repository.
